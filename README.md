# AI Chat Bot App

## General Process & Overview

<p>This project was created for the Congressional App Challenge; however it is still a WIP.</p>

<p>To create this application, I had to learn how to use the React framework to create the frontend portion of this project. Using NPM, I was able to create a React app, as NPM gave me a React template to edit. From there, I pieced the different portions of the project together by connecting the React file with the JavaScript file, then connecting that to the CSS and HTML files. In the future, I will consider publishing this on a website, once I spruce up the CSS. </p>
